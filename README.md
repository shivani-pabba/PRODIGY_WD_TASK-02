# PRODIGY_WD_TASK-02
Created a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Structured the interface with HTML, styled it for clarity and responsiveness with CSS, and implemented JavaScript functions to handle start, pause, reset, and lap time tracking. The result is an interactive and user-friendly tool for accurately measuring and recording time intervals.
